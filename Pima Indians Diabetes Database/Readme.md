# Pima Indians Diabetes Database

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Pima Indians Diabetes Database project. The goal of this project is to analyze the Pima Indians diabetes dataset and develop a predictive model to classify whether a person has diabetes or not based on various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The project follows a data analytics process, including data extraction, cleaning, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains data on female patients of Pima Indian heritage, collected for diabetes-related research. The dataset consists of several features, including:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin level
- BMI: Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Target variable indicating if the person has diabetes (1) or not (0)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Extraction: The dataset is obtained from the source ([DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)).
2. Data Cleaning: The extracted data is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The cleaned data is explored to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the dataset.
4. Feature Engineering: Additional features may be created or existing features may be transformed to improve the model's performance.
5. Model Training: Machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost are trained on the dataset to predict diabetes.
6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Conclusion and Recommendations: Based on the model performance and analysis, conclusions are drawn, and recommendations may be provided for further action.
