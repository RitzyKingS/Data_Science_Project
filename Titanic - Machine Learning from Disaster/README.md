# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains a machine learning project based on the Titanic dataset. The objective of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques to build an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, consists of information about passengers on board the Titanic, including details such as their age, gender, class, fare, cabin, and survival status. The dataset is divided into two files: `train.csv` (containing the training set) and `test.csv` (containing the test set).

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of variables, and identify patterns and correlations.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing ones, extract meaningful information, and transform variables to improve the performance of machine learning models.

- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict the survival of passengers.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Repository Contents

- `Python Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
