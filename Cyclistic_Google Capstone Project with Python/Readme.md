# Cyclistic: Google Data Analytics Capstone

This repository contains the Cyclistic Google Data Analytics Capstone project. The project focuses on analyzing and providing insights into the Cyclistic bike-sharing data to understand user behavior and develop data-driven recommendations to increase the number of annual members. The project follows the data analytics process, including data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, to derive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Cyclistic bike-sharing data and uncover insights that can help increase the number of annual members. The project encompasses the following key steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: The Cyclistic bike-sharing data is extracted from the available sources. This may involve accessing the database or downloading the dataset provided by Cyclistic.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The extracted data is cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step involves handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and resolving any inconsistencies in the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The cleaned data is explored to gain a comprehensive understanding of the variables and their relationships. Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and data profiling techniques are used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

4. **Identifying User Behavior**: The project focuses on analyzing user behavior to identify key factors influencing the number of annual members. This may involve analyzing factors such as trip duration, time of day, day of the week, user demographics, popular routes, and bike availability.

5. **Segmentation Analysis**: The data is segmented based on user characteristics and behavior to uncover insights specific to different user groups. This helps in understanding the preferences and needs of various user segments, allowing for targeted strategies.

6. **Visualizations**: Data visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps are created to effectively communicate insights and trends. This step involves using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, or other visualization libraries to create informative and visually appealing visualizations.

7. **Data-driven Recommendations**: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, data-driven recommendations are formulated to increase the number of annual members. These recommendations may include strategies to improve user experience, optimize bike availability, target marketing campaigns, or enhance the subscription process.

8. **Presentation and Documentation**: The findings, analysis, and recommendations are compiled into a comprehensive report or presentation. The report includes a summary of the project, data analysis methodology, key insights, visualizations, and actionable recommendations. The documentation provides clear instructions for replicating the analysis and using the project resources.
