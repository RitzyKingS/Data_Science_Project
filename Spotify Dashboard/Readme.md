## Project Overview

This advanced Power BI project offers a comprehensive analysis enriched with ChatGPT, custom visuals, and Python scripting. The project's main components include:

- Enriching the dataset with ChatGPT & Python.
- A visually striking Glassmorphism background.
- Building Power BI reports and dashboards.
- An HTML Cover Art for a polished presentation.
- Custom visuals using DENEB.
- Power BI formatting for a professional look.

## Repository Contents

- `spotify-2023.csv`: The original Spotify dataset from 2023.
- `updated_file.csv`: The cleaned and enriched dataset with ChatGPT and Python.
- `SpotifyScript.py`: Python script used for data enrichment.
- `Spotify_PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix`: The Power BI dashboard file.
- `Cover_Art.html`: An HTML cover art file for a visually appealing presentation.

## Enriching the Dataset

The project begins with data enrichment, where the `spotify-2023.csv` dataset is enhanced with insights generated from ChatGPT and Python using the `SpotifyScript.py`. The result is the `updated_file.csv`.

## Glassmorphism Background

The dashboard is set against an elegant Glassmorphism background, providing a visually pleasing and modern design.

## HTML Cover Art

To enhance the overall presentation, the project includes an HTML Cover Art file (`Cover_Art.html`), which is designed to complement the dashboard.

## Dependencies

- Power BI
- Python (for data enrichment)
- DENEB custom visuals
- HTML (for Cover Art)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `SpotifyScript.py` to enrich the dataset.
3. Open `Spotify_PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI to interact with the live dashboard.
4. Customize the project with additional data or design elements as needed.
